# Ticketee
**Ticketee** is the ticket-tracking application that the [Rails 4 In Action][1] book uses to teach a lot of awesome stuff. What I'm liking the most about this app, is that is being developed using [BDD][2] best practices.

I'm really enjoying this book, which I consider to be one of the best resources for learning Rails 4.

Some of the stuff covered by the book:

## Chapter 1
This chapter is just an overview of the Rails framework, covering basic stuff like:
* Installation (Actually this is covered in appendix A)
* Generating an app and starting it.
* The `scaffold` command.
* Migrations.
* Views.
* Model validations.
* Very basic routing.

All of it using a small toy app.

## Chapter 2
About how combining a [TDD][3] plus [BDD][2] approach can help us save our bacon and our sanity. The gems used for accomplish that are [RSpec][4] and [Capybara][5].

## Chapter 3
Here we start building the **Ticketee** app. It explains very basic [git][6] on [GitHub][7], and routing according to the Rails' team interpretation of the [REST architecture][8], and
how the 7 standard REST actions map to the 4 CRUD database operations.

## Chapter 4
It keeps building on [CRUD][9], and introduces [factory_girl gem][10] as an easier alternative to fixtures for feeding mock data to our tests.
Also covered the [bootstrap-sass gem][11] for pimping up the app, which honestly I couldn't care less, and found a bit distracting. A lot of bootstrap styling takes place but also introduces the awesome [simple_form gem][12] for easier form generation.

## Chapter 5
Now things start to get interesting with the introduction of **nested resources** and **callbacks**. The authors here explain how to use **nested routing helpers** that are automatically available after defining `tickets` as a nested resource (inside `projects`) in our routes.

## Chapter 6

## Chapter 7

## Chapter 8
1. Creating a `Role` model. Each record of the corresponding database table for this model, contains the role that a given user has on a specific project:

* Viewer: Read a specific project object.
* Editor: Same as above plus creating and updating ticket objects on a given project.
* Manager: Same as above plus editing project details.

2. Implementing a **whitelist authorization** system.
3. Use of the [Pundit gem][13]
4. During the whole chapter plenty of **feature tests** are written or previous tests are modified to check the permissions that restrict access to the CRUD actions on the `ProjectsController` and `TicketsController`. These permissions are granted by `Role` objects.
5. Finally, we implement the functionality that allow admins to assign roles to users.

## Chapter 9
This chapter is mostly about file uploading using the [carrierwave gem][14], but it teaches other useful things like:

* Removing the [turbolinks gem][15] from our application.
* Small introduction to [CoffeeScript][16] using a small script for helping when adding fields for uploading files.

## Chapter 10
In this part of the book we develop a feature for adding information about the state of a ticket. This is done using a select field in the comments.

We also implement the functionality that allows admins to add new states to the list, so users have more options to choose from. Admins also can rename, remove and set a default state so new tickets are never born stateless.

As usual the work start writing a BDD feature to describe the process of **creating a state**, and as always we walk our way to the final implementation by writing the minimal amount of code necessary to fix the spec failures.

The same procedure described above is followed for defining a method that allows setting a **default state** for tickets. With that method in place we just have to call that method every time a new ticket is created, and a **callback** in the `Ticket` model is perfect for that task, but only after a slight adjustment in the description of our feature for creating tickets.

Then we write another spec for the following requirement: **Editors** of a project should be able to leave comments but not change a ticketâ€™s state; only **managers** of a project (and **admins**) can change the state.

Finally we implement functionality to avoid little rascals from tampering with our forms and changing a ticket state. We do that by modifying the `create` action in our `CommentsController` so that the `state_id` parameter is removed before being passed to the `build` method, for all users other than **managers** and **admins**. As usual, the actual implementation is preceded by a spec feature.

## Chapter 11
This chapter covers tagging tickets, meaning the ability to add **tags** to tickets so we can group them together under a given tag. Then we can use these tags to implement a search functionality based on them. Creating and editing tags is not gonna be allowed to all users, only **managers** of a project and **admins** will be able to do that.

Creating tags is the first step, we need an interface for adding tags to new tickets, a simple **text field** underneath the ticket's description field. But before that, we need to add a new scenario to the spec for creating tickets. The steps taken to fix the failing spec:

* Create the text field itself for creating the tags in `views/tickets/_form.html.erb`.
* Creating a **virtual attribute** named `tag_names` inside the `Ticket` model.
* Add this attribute to the list of permitted parameters in `TicketsController`.
* Add markup for showing the tags in `views/tickets/show.html.erb`.
* Define the `tags` method with a `has_and_belongs_to_many` association between `Ticket` objects and `Tag` objects.
* Generate a `Tag` model with only a `name` field, and without any `timestamps` fields, we don't need them. Before running that migration, we generate another one for the **join table** for tags and tickets.
* Redefine the **setter method** for our virtual attribute `tag_names=` in the `Ticket` model.
* Creating a **partial template** for tags in `views/tags/_tag.html.erb` and add some styling.

Apart from adding tags upon ticket creation, every time we write a **comment** we should also be able of adding tags to an already existing ticket. For that we are gonna need to add another text field to our comment's form, but before that, as usual, we have to add a new scenario to our feature spec for creating comments. To fix the red spec we do:

* Create a partial in `views/tags/_form.html.erb`, which we render from both:

  * `views/tickets/_form.html.erb`
  * `views/comments/_form.html.erb`
* Define a `tag_names` virtual attribute in the `Comment` model too.
* Add this attribute to the list of permitted parameters in `CommentsController`.
* Add an `after_create` callback inside the `Comment` model, to the `associate_tags_with_ticket` method, and define the method itself.
